Project Origin & Overview
=========================

This project, `_name}}`, is a product of an internship opportunity with LG U+ conducted by `Alan Synn (alan@alansynn.com)`. `Alan`, while being part of the CDO MLOps team, dedicated skills and effort into crafting this open-source Python library.

The inception of `{{official_name}}` happened with the objective of providing a robust platform to support popular model compression techniques. Unlike many other utilities, `{{official_name}}` is not restricted to one or two frameworks and backends. Instead, it is designed to support multi-frameworks and backends with all mainstream deep learning frameworks - TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX Runtime, and MXNet.

Currently, `{{official_name}}` aims to support checkpoint compression for model training. This feature is currently under development and will be released in the near future.

-----
